## Welcome!

You've reached the GitHub repository of Ryan Brookes - what a time to be alive.

### About Me

I'm a software engineer for BT and programming enthusiast. I am trying to study in my free time so I can improve my game during paid time. Whether that's working remains to be seen...

### Projects

So far, I've worked on:

* ImageJ/Leap Motion: Yet to upload work in this area but it was done as part of my dissertation
* My super basic front page, which is just a playground for me to try front-end technologies: rpbrookes.github.io

### Reach Me

If you have any questions about my work or want to get in touch, my handle is @rpbrookes.

### Creating single page navigation

```<a href="/.classname"> About me </a>```

Adding for example /.aboutme in the href ref means you can target a class on the page

like your about section and when user clicks about Me in navigation page will move to about container.

*you can use Id's instead aslong as every ID is different

### Using CDN

CDN's are ok in some respect to use and i mainly use on fontawesome or really small things.


```<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet">```
<br>
simply place this in your head tag with the css files

then when you wish to use ICON in buttons , labels wherever you just place the tag

 ```<i class="fa fa-github-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>```
 
 its the same for everything its just a case of changing ```fa fa-github-alt``` to the icon you wish to use for example.
 
 ### GOOGLE FONTS
 
 Google Fonts is an awesome website that use's maxCDN and gets added to your head tags
